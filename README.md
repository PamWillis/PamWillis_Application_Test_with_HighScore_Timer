# Creating a Quiz for Employee Applicants

## Description

This project entails the use of multiple files of HTML and javascript, along with a CSS file

- It was required that I create a site that would take the job applicant thru a series of questions. The problems would be graded along the way in order to recieve a final grade. The applicant could then enter initials and either try again or enter for a final highscore rating. The highscore rating would be kept on the first page, so others could compete against that.
- It was built in order to learn how to push and pull information from the local server, in order to keep track of high scores. The problems were used in order to flip between questions and compared to achieve a point. ID's and classes were used in order to hide pages and make other pages appear. A timer was also incorporated to limit the time and take off time for wrong answers. When time ended, score was given.
- The application allows scores to be kept locally, without having to save everything to a server.
- Javascript methods were used to get and set information to and from the local Server. Script and href were used to navigat thru the two pages. If statements and for loops were used to analyze the events as the data was being entered.


## Usage
